	 *  			portfolio management. It is used to manage and provide access
	 *  			to a database of potential projects, and to support a process
	 *  			for maturing project ideas until they are ready to be 
	 *  			scheduled for execution. Rudimentary tools for tracking
	 *  			projects during execution are also present.
	 *  
	 *  			This application was intended to reproduce the functionality
	 *  			of a legacy application in Zope, build with a relational
	 *  			database (mysql), and user authentication and authorization
	 *  			in LDAP.
